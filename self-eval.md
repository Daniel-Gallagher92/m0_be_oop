# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
- Everything was all fun and games until we had to feed our dragon! Then I had to start digging through docs. Aurora saved me on the hobbit example. I was passing unnecessary parameters and confusing myself with clunky code. She's an actual angel.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
- Overall workflow is going well. Today shook me up a little bit in terms of the exercises, but I utilized the study hall and that was my biggest break. I'm so happy that is a part of this program.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1? Use the docs, but don't continue down rabbit holes once I've established the material is not going to serve me. I lost so much time just reading further and further.
